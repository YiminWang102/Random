# Random
Generate a truly Random Bitmap Image

When you press the "Generate Random Image Button" we are making a request to random.org for almost 50,000 random integers ranging from 0 to 256.

You might have to install the following chrome plugin if you get the "...is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin" error  https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi/related?hl=en-US

Be careful, if you go over your alloted 'bits' from random.org, you won't be able to request more random numbers.
